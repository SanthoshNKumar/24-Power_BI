    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Your data might be an 'Excel spreadsheet', or a 'collection of cloud-based' and 'on-premises hybrid data warehouses'.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a '*tool*' in '*business intelligence*' that converts '*data*' from various data sources to interactive BI *reports* and *dashboards*. With Power BI, you can quickly connect your data, wrap it, visualize it as needed, and share it on sites securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a tool in the category of '*Business Intelligence(BI)*'.The purpose of BI is to track Key ***Performance Indicators (KPIs)*** and uncover insights in business data so as to better inform decision-making across the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is used in different ways depending on the role of the individual, from developers, analysts, managers, and directors, to everyone in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables users to easily connect to various `data sources`, create `data models`, and design interactive `reports` and `visualizations`.

    "**Top Uses/Benefits of Power Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Transforming data\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Pivot / Unpivot\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Splitting / Merging Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Filtering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Creating custom columns\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Deleting header / blank / error rows\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Changing data types\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Fill down values\n",
    "\n",
    "        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Repeatable steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Power Query also remembers each of the steps that were taken to transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This means that when reports are refreshed or changes are made, model inputs can be refreshed in seconds, with no need to re-do the whole process from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Combining multiple tables\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Power Query allows us to combine multiple tables of related data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Excel users would achieve the same task using lookup formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Power Query joins the tables efficiently using matching columns, does not require any formulas, and is achieved for the entire dataset in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Combining multiple files\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Power Query includes functionality to seamlessly combine data from multiple similar files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Ex: Suppose we have three similar files, each containing sales data for our stores in a given month. Our model requires a single file with a consolidated list of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   With Power Query, we can easily combine the above files into a single table\n",
    "\n",
    "        ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Connection to central data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Power Query includes many connectors that allow you to pull data from SQL databases, web pages, cloud storage, and local files.\n",
    "    -   By always referencing central sources of data, analysts can ensure they are all working from the one version of the truth.\n"
