    "## What is Power BI \n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a collection of '*software services*', '*apps'*, and '*connectors'* that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immerse, and interactive insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Your data might be an 'Excel spreadsheet', or a 'collection of cloud-based' and 'on-premises hybrid data warehouses'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` lets you easily connect to your '*data sources'*, '*visualize*' and '*discover*' what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a '*tool*' in '*business intelligence*' that converts '*data*' from various data sources to interactive BI *reports* and *dashboards*. With Power BI, you can quickly connect your data, wrap it, visualize it as needed, and share it on sites securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is a tool in the category of '*Business Intelligence(BI)*'.The purpose of BI is to track Key ***Performance Indicators (KPIs)*** and uncover insights in business data so as to better inform decision-making across the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Power BI` is used in different ways depending on the role of the individual, from developers, analysts, managers, and directors, to everyone in between.\n"
